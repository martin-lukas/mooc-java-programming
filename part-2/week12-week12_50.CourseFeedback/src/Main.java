            This course was really great. Even though I already knew a lot of Java before,
            it was still challenging enough to keep things interesting. I especially liked
            the bigger projects at the end of the week, where the directiongs were
            intentionally very general, and we had to figure the structure of the program
            ourselves.I think that's when I was learning the most. Thank you so much for
            this course.
